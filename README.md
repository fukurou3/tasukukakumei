# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
    npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

### Google Calendar integration

Events are now synced using the Google Calendar API. Set `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` to your OAuth client ID. Background synchronization runs automatically via WorkManager (Android) and BGTaskScheduler (iOS) through Expo's background fetch API. Logs are written when the task starts and ends, and errors are reported to the console. Only changes since the last sync are fetched using the API sync token. When `Googleカレンダー連携` is enabled in the settings screen, events for the selected day will appear above the task list.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
